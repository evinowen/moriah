A mod for The Binding of Isaac: Repentance

Build
------
Run `scripts\build.ps1` to create a deployable copy of the mod.

This is a required step because of the way that Lua files are included during the development process.  Essentially,
**The Binding of Isaac: Repentance** does not support reloading any mod files except for `main.lua`. To circumvent this
limitation, independent files are maintained for each object and concatenated into a single source `main.lua` file to be
deployed to the mod directory of the game.

Deploy
------
Run `scripts\deploy.ps1` to copy the directory contents to the appropriate Steam directory for **The Binding of Isaac: Repentance** mods.

Catalog
